# ðŸ§  English to French Translator using NLP and RNN (Seq2Seq)

This project implements a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) deep learning model using LSTM layers to translate English sentences into French. It uses standard NLP preprocessing, tokenization, and embedding techniques to train a neural translation model.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- **Model Type:** Encoder-Decoder with LSTM
- **Goal:** Translate English text to French
- **Techniques Used:** NLP, Tokenization, Padding, Embedding, LSTM
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, Gensim, WordCloud, Plotly, Seaborn

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- Two text files with aligned English and French sentences.
- Files used:
  - `small_vocab_en.csv`
  - `small_vocab_fr.csv`
- Loaded from Google Drive via Colab.

## ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing Steps

1. Removed punctuation
2. Tokenized using NLTK
3. Counted word frequency (visualized with WordCloud & Plotly)
4. Found max sentence length
5. Tokenized and padded both English and French datasets
6. Vocabulary size determined
